A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable (3rd ed.).

Or use the following bibtex entry:

```
@book{molnar2025,

  year={2025},
  subtitle={A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable},
  edition={3},
  url={https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book}
}
```

I'm always curious about where and how interpretation methods are used in industry and research.
If you use the book as a reference, it would be great if you wrote me a line and told me what for.
This is, of course, optional and only serves to satisfy my own curiosity and to stimulate interesting exchanges.
